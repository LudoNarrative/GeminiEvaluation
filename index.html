				<p>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a set of abstract games. You will first answer preliminary questions and then play and answer questions about three different games. If you have any questions throughout the study, raise your hand.</p>

			<div class="intro" id="intro1">

				<p>You will play 3 games for 5 minutes each, and answer a set of questions after each one. Each game will work in different ways. We won't tell you exactly how each one works, because we want to know how understandable the games are on their own. Instead, we will give you a range of things you might be able to do or events that might happen in the games, so you can try things out and figure out how the game works for yourself.</p>

				<p>Remember, we are testing the games, not you!</p>

				<p>Click next to see the range of possible actions and events that might appear in each game.</p>

			<div class="intro" id="intro2">

				<p>These are the range of possible actions and events that might appear in each game. Not all will be applicable for a single game.</p>

				<p>Click next to start playing the first game. You will have a maximum of 5 minutes to play this game before progressing to the survey. You may restart the game as many times as you'd like, but don't refresh the page.</p>
